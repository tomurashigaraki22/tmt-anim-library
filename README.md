# Animation Library using Framer Motion

Welcome to the **Animation Library**! This package allows you to easily apply a variety of animations to your React components with the power of [Framer Motion](https://www.framer.com/motion/). Our library provides simple and reusable animation components that you can directly integrate into your projects.

## Installation

To install the library, you need to add it to your project via `npm` or `yarn`.

### Using npm


npm install tmt-anim-library


I'll rewrite the content using only markdown formatting and comments, without any code blocks. Here's how it would look:

# Usage

Here's a simple example of how to use the animations in your React project:

## Importing Animations

To use an animation, import it into your component.

*import { FadeIn, SlideIn, Bounce } from '@your-username/animation-library';*

## Using an Animation

Apply the animation to your component like this:

*import React from 'react';*
*import { FadeIn, SlideIn, Bounce } from 'tmt-anim-library';*

*const MyComponent = () => (*
*`<div>`*
*`<FadeIn>`*
*`<h1>`This is a FadeIn animation!`</h1>`*
*`</FadeIn>`*

```plaintext
*<SlideIn>*
  *<p>This is a SlideIn animation!</p>*
*</SlideIn>*

*<Bounce>*
  *<button>Click me!</button>*
*</Bounce>*
```

*`</div>`*
*);*

*export default MyComponent;*

In this example, the `FadeIn`, `SlideIn`, and `Bounce` components are used to animate different parts of the component.

## Animations Provided

The library includes several built-in animations that you can use out of the box:

### FadeIn

Applies a fade-in effect to the wrapped content.

*`<FadeIn duration={1}>`Content goes here`</FadeIn>`*

### SlideIn

Slides the wrapped content from a specified direction (left, right, top, or bottom).

*`<SlideIn direction="left" duration={0.5}>`Content goes here`</SlideIn>`*

### Bounce

Adds a bounce effect to the wrapped content.

*`<Bounce duration={1}>`Content goes here`</Bounce>`*

### Custom Animations

You can also create your own custom animations by adjusting the properties of Framer Motion components directly in your project.

## Customization

You can customize the animations in the following ways:

- **Duration**: Set the duration of the animation to control how fast or slow it plays.
- **Direction**: For animations like SlideIn, choose from left, right, top, and bottom to control the direction.
- **Easing**: Customize the easing function for more control over the animation flow (e.g., ease-out, ease-in).
- **Delay**: Add a delay before the animation starts.


For example:

*`<FadeIn duration={2} delay={0.5}>`*
*`<h2>`This text will fade in slowly with a delay`</h2>`*
*`</FadeIn>`*
